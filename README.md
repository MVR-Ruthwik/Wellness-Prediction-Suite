# Wellness Prediction Suite 🩺💻

## Overview 🌟
The Wellness Prediction Suite is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, pneumonia, liver disease, kidney disease, and brain stroke. Built using Flask, it provides personalized health predictions and dietary recommendations through a user-friendly interface, empowering users to take proactive measures for their well-being. 📊

## Features ✨
- **Disease Prediction** 🩻: Utilizes machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM) to predict disease likelihood based on user-provided health data.
- **Dietary Recommendations** 🍽️: Offers evidence-based dietary advice tailored to predicted health risks.
- **User-Friendly Interface** 🖥️: Intuitive web interface for easy data input and result visualization.
- **Real-Time Predictions** ⚡: Processes health data to deliver instant predictive insights.
- **Feedback Mechanism** 📝: Collects user feedback to improve model accuracy and user experience.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
- **Python** 🐍: Core programming language for backend development.
- **Flask** 🌐: Web framework for building the application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🤖: For developing and training machine learning models.
- **NumPy** 🔢: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** 🎨: For front-end development.

## Software Requirements 💻
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 (Min) 🖼️
- **Front End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🌐
- **Back End**: Python 🐍
- **Database**: MySQL 🗄️

## Installation ⚙️

### Install requirements (using a virtual environment is preferable):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run this command to start local server:
```sh
python app.py
```

## Usage 🚀
1. Start the local server using the command above. 🌐
2. Open a secure browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Brave) and navigate to the provided local server URL (typically `http://localhost:5000`). 🖥️
3. Input health data or upload relevant files (e.g., chest X-ray for pneumonia detection) through the web interface. 📤
4. View personalized disease predictions and dietary recommendations. 📊
5. Provide feedback via the interface to help improve the system. 📝

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](Documentation.pdf) 📚.

## Project Structure 🏗️
- **Data Collection and Processing** 📂: Preprocesses health data for model training.
- **Model Development** 🤖: Trains machine learning models for disease prediction.
- **Web Interface** 🖥️: Flask-based interface for user interaction.

## Future Scope 🔮
- Enhance model accuracy with continuous refinement. 📈
- Integrate real-time data streams and adaptive learning. 🌐
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals for clinical validation. 🩺
- Address data privacy, model interpretability, and regulatory compliance for broader adoption. 🔒
